## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Local custom font with `@font-face`

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce the importance of using semantic HTML and how small design elements (like `border-radius` and `box-shadow`) contribute significantly to user experience. I also practiced making layouts responsive and learned to use `box-sizing: border-box` to avoid padding/layout issues.
